# VyConnect - VyOS Multi-Router UI Controller

This is one of my first open-source releases. Please add a ‚≠ê if you like the idea of this project or if you like to use it.

Feel free to contribute.

VyConnect is an open-source web interface for managing multiple VyOS routers via the official VyOS REST API instead of SSH ensuring safe connectivity without compromising on security. It provides a centralized way to configure and monitor multiple VyOS routers, with features for NAT, firewalls, interfaces, logging, performance monitoring, and more. The project aims to simplify multi-router management, providing a more integrated and user-friendly approach than managing routers individually via CLI.

## üöÄ Installation

Follow the steps below to set up VyConnect and connect it to your VyOS router through the REST API.

### 1. **Set up the VyOS REST API**

On your VyOS router, enable the REST API with the following commands in the VyOS CLI:

```bash
set service https api keys id vyconnect key YOUR_SECRET_KEY
set service https api rest
commit && save
```

Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your own chosen secret key. This is used to securely communicate between VyConnect and your VyOS router.

### 2. **Configure Ethernet Interfaces, Speed, and Duplex**

Ensure your Ethernet interfaces are properly configured with the correct speed and duplex settings.

### 3. **Copy and Edit the Configuration File**

Copy `default.config.json` to `config.json` and modify the values to suit your setup. Be sure to include the correct router settings and REST API credentials.

### 4. **Access and Default Password**

Use PHP to serve /web. If you are using Windows, you can open host_web.cmd, which runs the webpanel. Make sure you have got a recent version of PHP installed on your host system!

The default password for VyConnect is `vyconnect`. Use this to log into the web interface.
